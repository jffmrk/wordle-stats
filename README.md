# Wordle Stats

I play on the following sites:

* https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
* https://metzger.media/games/wordle-archive/
* https://www.devangthakkar.com/wordle_archive/

After each game, I share my results and add them to the Notes app on my iPhone.

    Wordle 248 3/6*
    ⬛🟨⬛⬛⬛
    ⬛🟩⬛🟩🟩
    🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩

I then copy/paste the whole notes file and into a file `wordle.txt`

The `wordle.sh` script will generate my stats:
